Disrupting Coffee Distribution. Bringing beans to life
My name is Louis Mayaud. I have 3 years experience in the coffee trade, in origin, creating specialty coffee supply chains, for special customers, paying higher prices for greater positive impact. I am convinced that focusing on quality improves people's lives by improving the way they work, and their income.
